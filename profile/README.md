# Terminal Collective üñ•Ô∏è

Terminal Collective is a community for open-source terminal software enthusiasts.

We bring together developers of terminal software and users who share a passion for the terminal and its ecosystem.

Our goal is to create a space where people can share their work, learn from each other, and collaborate on terminal-related projects.
